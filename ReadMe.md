# Introduction
This is a collection of shell scripts which update, perform a set of pre defined tasks on a Rapberry Pi. These enable the user to do simple but ofetn missed out tasks like updating the OS on every boot, etc.

## Scripts and their functionality

- update.sh updates the Raspbian OS everytime the Rpi boots up (you may have to edit the config files to make this feature work on your machine).
- More will be added soon...
